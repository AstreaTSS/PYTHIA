A bot made to help automate investigations during Danganronpa RPs.

A niche use, but it comes in use because doing it manually takes quite a bit of time.

The bot relies on a user to find out a 'key word' in order to actually get the Truth Bullet. It's up to the people who use this to hint at the key words.
